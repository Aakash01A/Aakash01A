## About

I’m a pre-final year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, currently building a focused path into cybersecurity with an emphasis on defensive security and threat detection.

My primary interests lie in understanding how systems and applications generate security-relevant data, and how logs, alerts, and monitoring workflows are used to identify and respond to suspicious activity. I actively work on hands-on labs involving Linux, networking, log analysis, SIEM fundamentals, and web application behavior from a defender’s perspective.

Alongside this, I work in a full-stack development environment, which helps me understand how real-world applications are built, deployed, and where security gaps commonly emerge. I use this experience to connect development practices with security monitoring and detection.

I’m currently strengthening my coding skills in Python and focusing on building practical, well-documented projects that combine security fundamentals, automation, and clear incident-style analysis, with a long-term goal of moving into cloud security and security engineering roles.

## Current Focus

* Linux fundamentals for security operations  
* System and application log analysis  
* Understanding SOC workflows and alert triage  
* Building small, well-documented defensive labs

## Skills

* Linux (filesystem, permissions, processes, logs)  
* Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)  
* Log analysis (Linux & basic Windows events)  
* Basic SIEM concepts (alerts, queries, false positives)

## Projects & Labs

* **Linux Log Analysis Lab**  
  Investigated Linux authentication and system logs to identify failed login patterns, suspicious activity, and normal baselines. Findings are documented from a defender’s perspective.

* **SOC Alert Triage Simulation**  
  Simulated basic security alerts and analyzed whether activity was malicious or benign, focusing on alert context and false-positive reduction.

* **Basic Network Traffic Analysis**  
  Analyzed network traffic samples to understand common protocols and identify anomalous behavior relevant to SOC monitoring.
